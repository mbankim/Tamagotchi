Tentative Difficulty: 3

- JSYK, as you drop features the difficulty drops. The fact that you have a store and evolution puts you in 3.
  If you drop those, the 'feeding' + 'cleaning' + minigames leaves you at 2.5. Dropping minigames puts you at 2.
  This scaling should be on par with the other team doing a "pet nursing simulator".

I would play this! :)
